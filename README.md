This is a tool that aims to get rid the days of opening your skins folder, editing .png images and watching tutorials.

It makes tinkering and editing skins a walk in the park, providing an easy to use interface that requires no prior knowledge of skinning.

## Features

### Create a skin mix in seconds
 
- Choose what hitcircles to use, what sounds you want etc.. and it's done! - no need to scour through your skins folder in file explorer.

- Expand an option by clicking its arrow button to explore a myriad of sub-options; you can even choose a specific .png file!

### Modify your existing skins

- Want to quickly change the cursor of a skin, or multiple skins at once?

- Or.. do you want to convert a skin to use a smooth cursor trail, instant-fading hitcircles or an invisible cursor?

- A couple clicks and your modified skin is ready to go!

### Manage your skins folder

- A place to view a preview of your skin, duplicate or delete it from your system. Search for a skin and open it directly in osu!

- Do you have loads of skins? You can hide skins so they don't show up in osu! + restore them at any time from the skin manager.
